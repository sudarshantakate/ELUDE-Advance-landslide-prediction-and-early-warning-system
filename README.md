# ELUDE-Advance-landslide-prediction-and-early-warning-system
ELUDE is an innovative solution designed to enhance safety in landslide-prone regions by providing real-time monitoring, analysis, and early warnings. By integrating a network of sensors with advanced machine learning algorithms, ELUDE continuously tracks environmental conditions to detect potential landslide risks with high accuracy.
#Abstract 
Elude is a foundational landslide detection and early warning system leveraging a 
localized network of cost-effective hardware for real-time environmental and physical 
monitoring. The current implementation integrates data from rain sensors to quantify 
precipitation, temperature and humidity sensors to track conditions influencing soil 
moisture, and vibration sensors to directly detect subtle ground movements indicative of 
potential slope instability. An Arduino microcontroller serves as the central data acquisition 
hub, converting analog sensor signals via an analog-to-digital converter. Data is then 
wirelessly transmitted using ESP modules to a custom-built software user interface, 
providing a platform for real-time data visualization and the initial implementation of 
threshold-based alerts. 
 
 
Our motivation lies in creating a tangible and effective solution tailored to the specific 
environmental and geological context of Pune. Leveraging accessible and cost-effective 
hardware, combined with a custom-designed monitoring interface, elude offers a practical 
approach to landslide risk reduction. This project is driven by a commitment to enhancing 
community resilience and contributing to a safer environment for the residents of Pune. By 
providing early warnings, we aspire to create a system that not only saves lives and protects 
livelihoods but also fosters a greater awareness of landslide risks and promotes proactive 
disaster preparedness within the local context.
